        I am Raphael Spies: Full Stack Software Engineer, architecture enthusiast, and lifelong learner.

        Originally from Ithaca, NY, I attended University of California, Berkeley. I graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor's in Development Studies and a minor in Urban Planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 2014-2020, I worked in construction management, eventually working my way up to fulltime Project Manager. I specialized primarily in commercial interiors, specifically on Office (Tenant Improvement) renovations and hospitality.

        <p>
        Following the downturn in construction starts in late 2020, I took the opportunity to pursue what until then I thought could only be a dream for me: to become a full-time Software Engineer. I started programming again in December, joined the Hack Reactor pre-course program, and then starting in April 2021, joined the Full-Stack Software Engineering Immersive. I graduated in July 2021, and have been writing web apps ever since!

        I'm a technology and architecture enthusiast, lifelong learner, and an avid rock climber. I have two lovely cats, and my ideal weekend is spent either backpacking or climbing in the Sierra Mountains. ...

        Some personal nuggets:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Rock climbing, like software engineering, is about solving novel problems: in climbing you need to “read” the route before you start so you can find the endpoint, and the “crux”, or hardest part of the route. No two routes are the same--but the key to solving any route is knowing when to plan ahead, and when to improvise.

        - When I was 12, I attended MacHack in Dearborn Michigan. Steve Wozniak was the keynote speaker, and regaled us with stories of some of his best pranks. My "Hack" was an AppleScript app which slowly dragged all the desktops icons towards the Trash, and would follow the trash icon if you moved it around on the desktop.

        - I've hiked to the top of Mt. Whitney twice!
