        Originally from Ithaca, NY, I attended University of California, Berkeley. I graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor's in Development Studies and a minor in Urban Planning.

        In 2014, I left California for New York City, where I found my first job in construction management working as a temp at Americon Construction. I spent several years there, working on a range of projects in commercial offices, high-end retail, historic renovations, and more. After Americon, I moved to Certified of NY, where I worked primarily on Dadong, a Chinese Fine-Dining experience on 42nd street in Manhattan.

        In 2017 I relocated to Los Angeles where I joined Steelwave, a vertically-integrated real estate company with commercial properties throughout the Western US. There I managed various commercial office Tenant Improvement & Common Area projects, including Kobe Bryant's Headquarters, Casanova // McCann, and others. I also provided pre-construction services to Steelwave's in-house Real Estate Development team, including various early-phase roles in their ambitious 430,000 SF office complex at The Press, located inside the Los Angeles Times' old newsprinting facility in Costa Mesa, CA.

        2019 brought a new start, this time in hotel renovations. Comren Inc., a Los Angeles-based General Contractor, hired me on as a Project Manager to work on projects in Southern California and throughout the U.S. Notable projects included the Hilton Westside LA in Culver City, CA; and pre-construction/model rooms projects for the Westin Georgetown in Washington, D.C.

        Following the downturn in construction starts in late 2020, I took the opportunity to pursue what until then I thought could only be a dream for me: to become a full-time Software Engineer. I started programming again in December, joined the Hack Reactor pre-course program, and then starting in April 2021, joined the Full-Stack Software Engineering Immersive. I graduated in July 2021, and have been writing web apps ever since!

        I'm a technology and architecture enthusiast, lifelong learner, and an avid rock climber. I have two lovely cats, and my ideal weekend is spent either backpacking or climbing in the Sierra Mountains. ...

        Some personal nuggets:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Rock climbing, like software engineering, is about solving novel problems: in climbing you need to “read” the route before you start so you can find the endpoint, and the “crux”, or hardest part of the route. No two routes are the same--but the key to solving any route is knowing when to plan ahead, and when to improvise.

        - When I was 12, I attended MacHack in Dearborn Michigan. Steve Wozniak was the keynote speaker, and regaled us with stories of some of his best pranks. My "Hack" was an AppleScript app which slowly dragged all the desktops icons towards the Trash, and would follow the trash icon if you moved it around on the desktop.

        - I've hiked to the top of Mt. Whitney twice!
